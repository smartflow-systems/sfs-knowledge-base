# Installation

This guide covers installation for all supported platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

## Installation Methods

### Using npm

The easiest way to install is using npm:

```bash
npm install -g our-platform-cli
```

### Using yarn

Alternatively, you can use yarn:

```bash
yarn global add our-platform-cli
```

### From Source

For development purposes, you can install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/our-org/platform.git
cd platform
npm install
npm link
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
our-platform --version
```

You should see the version number printed to the console.

## Configuration

Create a configuration file in your home directory:

```bash
our-platform config init
```

This will create a `.platformrc` file with default settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get a "command not found" error:

1. Make sure the installation completed successfully
2. Check that your PATH includes the npm global bin directory
3. Try restarting your terminal

### Permission errors

On macOS/Linux, you may need to use `sudo`:

```bash
sudo npm install -g our-platform-cli
```

Or configure npm to install packages globally without sudo.
